# music-recommendation
This is a fun starter project in Machine Learning
The main code is the music-recommender_train_test.ipynb, which can be used with any csv from a database.
The trained model is save in model_persistence.ipynb for making sure big datasets don't need to be trained again
current set-up is to choose 80% data for testing and 20% for testing. This can be modified in the train_test_split Tuple
Note: accuracy score changes between runs because data selection is random.
Enjoy!
